<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>
Welcome to the <code>asudis</code> project on github. These are style files written by me (John Shumway) 
and used and improved by a number of Ph. D. and graduate students at ASU over the past few years.
We've used this for about a half-dozen Ph. D. dissertations. The current files pass the format requirements 
in spring 2013, and we continue to work together to update this to the latest formats.
</p>

<p>I graduated from Illinois with a Ph. D. in computational physics in 1999. At the time,
I wrote my on LaTeX style files for my Ph. D. dissertation. The department there picked up my files
and many other students used them for their dissertations. I reused some parts of them for NSF grant applications,
but mostly I left the code alone after starting as a professor of physics at ASU in 2001.
</p>
<p>Around 2008, after wasting hours trying to help one of my Ph. D. students get their LaTeX to
format correctly right before a submission deadline, I decided to write a new template for my next
students. That's how this package came into being. By far the trickiest part of the formatting is
the table of contents, and I believe this is the first one-shot LaTeX solution that adheres to the
format. That said, we still see occasional bugs, and I invite clever Ph. D. students to improve on 
the existing template.
</p>
<p>
In 2013, I had an opportunity to join a startup company in high performance computing, 
<a href="http://stoneridgetechnology.com">Stone Ridge Technology</a>, 
located in Bel Air, Maryland. 
ASU kindly granted me a leave of absense from my Associate
Professor position, and I now spend my days writting high performance software in C++ and CUDA
with a bunch of very smart physicts, engineers, computer scientists, and mathematicians.
Ironically, a few months after leaving Tempe, the ASU Graduate College asked me if
they could recommend <code>asudis</code> as the official LaTeX solution for dissertations. So, I now monitor this
project remotely from Maryland. I like crowd-sourcing projects on the internet, so this isn't too bad, but
I do regret that I can't meet with students in person to answer questions. It also means that this project
is my evening/early-morning/weekend work, so I'm working on ways to help graduate students work together without
be being the bottleneck in communication.

Please contribute your own corrections. By sharing this we are making things easier for all students using 
LaTeX for the dissertations at ASU.
